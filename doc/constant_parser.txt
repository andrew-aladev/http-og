Please read "constants_parser" doc first.

Token parsing should be available for single constant.
The most basic example is "GET" token for HTTP v0.9.

"constant" = "GET"

We can assign 0 state for empty string, 1 for "G", 2 for "E", 3 for "T".
"max_state" will be "constant.length".

We need to maintain only fast type for state.
