Please read "constants_processor" and "constant_processor" docs first.

HTTP requires generic data processing.
Token values consist of variable amount of symbols.
The most basic example is "Host: example.com" token.

-----

We won't validate generic data, this task is not related to HTTP processor.
We will just define allowed alphabet and min/max length of data.

For example we want to process domains:

"alphabet" = [
  "a" - "z",
  "A" - "Z",
  "0" - "9",
  "[",
  "]",
  ".",
  "-"
]

"symbol_by_bytes":
[
  [0 ... 255]: 255,
  ["a"]: 0,
  ["b"]: 1,
  ["c"]: 2,
  ...
]

"min_length" = 1
"max_length" = 63

-----

We can assign "0" state for empty string (initial state), "1" for "e", "2" for "x", etc.
"max_state" will be "max_length".

We need to maintain only fast type for state.
