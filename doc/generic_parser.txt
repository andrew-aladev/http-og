Please read "constants_parser" and "constant_parser" docs first.

HTTP parser requires generic parser.
Token values consist of variable amount of symbols.
The most basic example is "Host: example.com" token.

-----

We won't validate data provided by generic parser, this task is not related to HTTP parser.
We will just define allowed alphabet and min/max length of data.

For example domain "example.com":

"alphabet" = [
  "a" - "z",
  "A" - "Z",
  ".",
  "-"
]
"min_length" = 1
"max_length" = 63

-----

We can assign 0 state for empty string (initial state), 1 for "e", 2 for "x", etc.
"max_state" will be "max_length".

We need to maintain only fast type for state.
